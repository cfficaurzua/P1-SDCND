# Lane Lines Detection
## Project 1
### Self Driving Car NanoDegree
---
Given images or video as an input, this algorithm can successfully detect straight lane lines using the hough transform and canny edge detection.
See the output videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIERRjmbTtU&list=PL2M3eNbHNxfPizmTBq9fFZnCdAGkHUVPr "Output videos").
I included a street from my location that I recorded.

## Requirements:
The [enviroment](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit "CarND-term1-starter-kit") is set with miniconda.
Git-LFS is necessary to download the video files.

## Content
- Proceseed images and video are found in the output folder
- Input images are found in the test_images folder
- The algorithm is expose in a jupyter notebook (P1.ipynb).
- Input videos are inside the main folder.
